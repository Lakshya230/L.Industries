<p>How do you explain artificial intelligence?<br><br>
 Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment. AI is a study of how human brain think, learn, decide and work, when it tries to solve problems. And finally this study outputs intelligent software systems.
