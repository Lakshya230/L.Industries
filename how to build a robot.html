        <h1>Robotics for beginners</h1>
        <p>The robotics industry is fast evolving. It is anticipated that robotics projects for beginners and automation will get more advanced and innovative in the near future. Robots are increasingly becoming useful for our day to days living.<br><br>

Industrial robots are becoming a very significant aspect of the manufacturing industries. They help to improve efficiency which is the essence of a contemporary factory. We have, therefore, created this robotics guide to help those who are working in the robotics industry, those who work with robots and any individual who has an interest in robotics. However, before we begin with the step by step tips on how to build a simple robot, we will begin with the basics.<br><br>
<h1>What Is A Robot? </h1><br><br>
In general, a robot can be defined as an electromechanical device which can react to its immediate environment in one way or the other, and autonomously take a decision or perform a task. <br><br>

A robot’s ability to take a decision and react to its environment is what distinguishes it from cars and toasters, for instance. These objects unlike a robot can’t identify as they could not perceive or react autonomously to their environment.<br><br>
The robot is commonly regulated by an electronic circuitry or computer program. A robotic platform or body is the part of a robot that determines how the robot will look and the role it will perform. The most commonly used robot platform is the wheeled type. It has some benefits when compared with other robot platforms. <br><br>

Some of these benefits include things like comparatively low-cost and plenty of design options. They equally come with simple structure and design. The wheeled robotic platform is the best type of robot body for beginners.

        <p><h3>Soldering Pencil</h3>
You need a soldering pencil. It an essential part of any electrical work. You’d use it for soldering and de-soldering items on circuit boards. For this how to make robot tutorial, the soldering pencil will help us to solder the cables of the motor.

The tip of a soldering pencil is very hot when it is heated up. You must, therefore, be cautious about the way you handle it to prevent injury. If you’re a first time user, take some time to get familiar with how to use the pencil before you begin working on your project. 

 

<h3>Needle-Nose Pliers</h3>
Needle-nose pliers are frequently utilized for cutting off the extra length of cables and wires. While pliers are commonly utilized for a project, they are not an essential part of this project.

 

<h3>Wire Stripper</h3>
A wire stripper is a hand-held device utilized for stripping the electrical insulation on wires. You can use the scissors as an alternative tool if you prefer. When utilizing a wire stripper, take care to only eliminate the first insulation layer. This exposes the lead wire inside and makes it easier for you to solder.</p>
